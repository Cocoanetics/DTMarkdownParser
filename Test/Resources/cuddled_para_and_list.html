<p>I did these things:</p>

<ul>
<li>bullet1</li>
<li>bullet2</li>
<li>bullet3</li>
</ul>

<p>I did these too:</p>

<ul>
<li>bullet1</li>
<li>bullet2</li>
<li>bullet3 this is
a longer one.</li>
</ul>

<p>And these in order:</p>

<ol>
<li>bullet1</li>
<li>bullet2</li>
<li>bullet3</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is an asterisk,
